<p>This is a user documentation of the ALICE tool, which can be used to
discover “crash vulnerabilities” in applications. Crash vulnerabilities
are problems that get exposed by a sudden power loss or system crash
while the application is running, and the application cannot recover
correctly after rebooting the machine. ALICE focuses on single-node
applications that run atop file systems. ALICE is different from similar
tools in that it aims to find vulnerabilities that might occur across
all file systems, including future ones. ALICE is also unique in
targeting vulnerabilities associated with different source-code lines of
the application, instead of checking the application’s correctness atop
arbitrarily (or systematically, but less useful) simulated crash
scenarios. ALICE is designed to be extensible: both how it checks
different source lines, and the combined behavior it assumes of
underlying file systems, can be customized. The ALICE tool is a
by-product of a research project
(<a href="http://research.cs.wisc.edu/adsl/Publications/alice-osdi14.html">http://research.cs.wisc.edu/adsl/Publications/alice-osdi14.html</a>)

<a id="chapter-1-installation" class="anchor" href="#chapter-1-installation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Chapter 1: Installation</h2>

<p>ALICE was tested to work on Ubuntu-12.02, and should be expected to work
on similar (i.e., Linux-like) operating systems. The following are
specific requirements:</p>

<ol>
<li>Python-2.7, as the default version of python invoked via
/usr/bin/env python.</li>
<li>Standard software build tools, such as gcc and GNU Make.</li>
<li>The libunwind libraries, installable in Ubuntu-12.02 using apt-get
install libunwind7.</li>
</ol>

<p>The following are the steps to install ALICE:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download the most recent source-code tarball of ALICE, and untar it.
This should produce a directory named alice.</li>
<li>Set the environmental variable ALICE_HOME to point to the alice
directory (i.e., the untared directory). For example, this can be
done by adding the line export ALICE_HOME=/wherever-untarred/alice
to your .bashrc file.</li>
<li>Set the PATH environmental variable to include the alice/bin
directory. For example, this can be done by adding the line export
PATH=$PATH:/wherever-untarred/alice/bin to your .bashrc file.</li>
<li>Install the alice-strace tracing framework by moving into the
alice/alice-strace directory, and running ./configure; make; make
install;</li>
</ol>

<a id="chapter-2-basic-usage" class="anchor" href="#chapter-2-basic-usage" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Chapter 2: Basic Usage</h2>

<p>The typical workflow for using ALICE has two steps. First, an
application workload is run, and a trace of its activities are recorded.
Second, ALICE is given this trace and a checker script (explained
later); ALICE explores the trace and displays discovered
vulnerabilities. This documentation explains the typical usage of ALICE
by using a toy application.</p>

<h4>
<a id="toy-application" class="anchor" href="#toy-application" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Toy application</h4>

<p>The toy application can be found in alice/example/toy/toy.c; the reader
is encouraged to go through it. The application does the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>It updates a file called file1, changing the contents of the file
from “hello” to “world”. The update is done using a typical “write
to temporary file and rename” sequence, so that the contents are
updated atomically. Immediately after updating, the application
prints a message to the user’s terminal (the user can then
supposedly assume that the file has been updated, and that the file
will contain “world” even if a power loss happens).</li>
<li>It creates two links to the file, link1 and link2. The (imaginary)
semantics of the toy application require both these links to be
created atomically (i.e., if a power loss happens, either both links
exist or neither do not).</li>
</ol>

<h4>
<a id="step-1-running-the-application-and-recording-a-trace" class="anchor" href="#step-1-running-the-application-and-recording-a-trace" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Step 1: Running the application and recording a trace</h4>

<p>A script that runs the application and records a trace, along with all
initialization setup, can be found in
alice/example/toy/toy_workload.sh; the reader is encouraged to go
through it.</p>

<p>To perform Step 1, two directories are needed. The first, the workload
directory, is where the files of the application will be stored. The
application, as it runs, will modify the workload directory and its
contents. For the toy application, this is the place where file1, link1,
and link2, are placed. The toy_workload.sh script first creates the
workload directory, workload_dir, and then initializes it with the file
file1 containing “hello”.</p>

<p>The other needed directory, traces directory is for storing the
(multiple) traces that are recorded as the application is run. The
toy_workload.sh script next creates this directory, traces_dir. After
setting up the workload directory and the traces directory, the
toy_workload.sh script does a few more initialization things: compiling
the toy.c application, and cding into workload_dir so that the toy
application can be run within there.</p>

<p>The toy_workload.sh script finally runs the application and records
traces, by issuing the following command:</p>

<p>alice-record --workload_dir . \ 
 --traces_dir ../traces_dir \ 
 ../a.out</p>

<p>If the reader is familiar with the strace utility, the above command is
similar to an invocation of strace: alice-record is a script that
records traces, while ../a.out is the actual application to be run (the
process and all subprocesses of ../a.out are traced, similar to strace
with the -ff option). The alice-record script requires two mandatory
arguments: the workload directory and the traces directory (alice-record
takes one more optional argument, --verbose, to control verbosity).</p>

<h4>
<a id="step-2-supply-alice-with-the-trace-and-the-checker-and-get-back" class="anchor" href="#step-2-supply-alice-with-the-trace-and-the-checker-and-get-back" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Step 2: Supply ALICE with the trace and the checker, and get back</h4>

<p>list of vulnerabilities</p>

<p>Step 2 requires the user to supply ALICE with a checker script. The
checker script will be invoked multiple times by ALICE, each invocation
corresponding to a (simulated) system crash scenario that could have
happened while the application was running in Step 1. During each
invocation, the checker script will be given a directory that reflects
the state of the workload directory if the (simulated) crash had really
happened. If the given crashed-state workload directory has an expected
(i.e., consistent) set of files, the checker script should exit with
status zero, and should exit with a non-zero status otherwise.</p>

<p>ALICE supplies the checker script with two command-line arguments. The
first is the path to the crashed-state workload directory. The second
command-line argument to the checker script is the path to an stdout
file. The stdout file contains all the messages that had been printed to
the user’s terminal at the time of the crash (corresponding to the
supplied crashed-state workload directory), and can be used by the
checker to check for durability, as explained below. Note that the
crashed-state workload directory supplied by ALICE might differ from the
original workload directory in Step 1. Hence, for applications that
expect the absolute path of the contents within the workload directory
to not have changed (a small subset of applications in our experience),
the checker script needs to move the supplied directory to the original
directory, and then operate atop the original directory.</p>

<p>The checker script for the toy application can be found in
alice/example/toy/toy_checker.py, and the reader is encouraged to go
through it. The script first changes the current working directory into
the crashed-state directory supplied by ALICE, and reads all the
messages printed in the terminal at the time of the crash by reading the
stdout file supplied by ALICE. If the application has printed the
“Updated file1 to world” message, the checker script makes sure that
file1 contains “world”; otherwise, the checker script makes sure that
file1 contains either “hello” or “world”. The checker script then makes
sure that either link1 and link2 are both present, or are both not
present. If any of the checked conditions do not hold, the checker
script results in an assertion failure, thus exiting with a non-zero
status (and thus informing ALICE that the application will fail if the
simulated crash scenario happens in real).</p>

<p>After writing the checker script, the user can invoke the alice-check
script to actually run ALICE and get the list of vulnerabilities. The
reader is encouraged to run the following command from within the
alice/example/toy directory, to get a list of vulnerabilities discovered
in the toy application (after running toy_workload.sh first).</p>

<p>alice-check --traces_dir=traces_dir --checker=./toy_checker.py</p>

<p>The alice-check script has the following arguments:</p>

<p>traces_dir
  ~ Mandatory. The traces directory, from Step 1.
 checker
  ~ Mandatory. The checker script.
 threads
  ~ Optional, default is 4. ALICE invokes checker scripts parallely,
    each checker script given a separate crashed-state directory to work
    on. Some applications do not allow multiple simultaneous
    invocations, and might require this option to be set to 1.
 debug_level
  ~ Optional, default is 0. Verbosity of warnings, can be 0, 1, or 2.
 ignore_mmap
  ~ Optional, default is False. The current version of ALICE does not
    trace mmap-writes, and cannot correctly work with application
    workloads that use memory mapping to modify relevant files (see
    caveats and limitations). If the recorded trace during Step 1
    involves a writeable mmap() to a seemingly relevant file,
    alice-check aborts execution by default. However, some application
    workloads use mmap() only on files that are irrelevant to crash
    consistency, for example to implement a shared-memory lock dealing
    with multi-process concurrency synchronization. This option can be
    set to True if the user is sure that the mmap()s observed while
    running the application workload are irrelevant to finding crash
    vulnerabilities. Some database applications use mmap() for
    concurrency control, even when configured not to use mmap() for
    otherwise accessing files, and require this option.</p>

<h4>
<a id="understanding-alices-output" class="anchor" href="#understanding-alices-output" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Understanding ALICE’s output</h4>

<p>ALICE first outputs a list of list of the logical operations that form
the update protocol used by the application workload invoked in Step 1.
The logical operations displayed is similar to a system-call trace,
except that it is easier to understand, for example substituiting file
names instead of file descriptor numbers.</p>

<p>ALICE then displays any discovered vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities are
displayed in two ways: dynamic vulnerabilities, relating to different
operations in the update protocol, and static vulnerabilities, relating
to source-code lines. The proper display of static vulnerabilities
requires the originally traced application to have debugging symbols;
also, ALICE associates each logical operation to one of the stack frames
in the logical operation’s stack trace to display static
vulnerabilities, and this association can sometimes be faulty.</p>

<p>ALICE is designed to be extensible. The current version of ALICE strips
off many features that were previously implemented, in hopes that a
smaller code base promotes extensions. However, the current version is
also not sufficiently commented, and does not follow some good coding
practices; a well-commented version of the software might be released in
the future if users shows interest.</p>

<p>To extend ALICE, readers are required to go through our publication
(<a href="http://research.cs.wisc.edu/adsl/Publications/alice-osdi14.html">http://research.cs.wisc.edu/adsl/Publications/alice-osdi14.html</a>)
to understand ALICE’s design and philosophy. Note that there is some
terminology difference between the publication and ALICE’s source code;
in particular, logical operations discussed in the publication
correspond to micro operations in the source code, while micro
operations in the publication correspond to disk operations in the
source code.</p>

<p>ALICE’s default exploration strategy, which investigates the ordering
and atomicity of each system call and reports any associated
vulnerabilities, is coded in alice/alicedefaultexplorer.py, and can be
easily changed. The alicedefaultexplorer.py code is complicated since it
displays static vulnerabilities and invokes checkers in multiple
threads. A functionally equivalent exploration strategy can be simpler.</p>

<p>ALICE’s default APM is coded in alice/alicedefaultfs.py, and can be
easily changed. The alicedefaultfs.py code is complicated since it
models a file system that can be configured to split file operations in
different granularities. A functionally equivalent file system (with a
single granularity) can be simpler.</p>

<p>Other than the extensions discussed till now, users might try to add
support for more system calls, file attributes, symbolic links, or other
such details, in ALICE. Relevant to these, the _aliceparsesyscalls.py
script contains code that converts system calls into logical operations,
while the replay_disk_ops() function from the alice.py script contains
code that re-constructs a directory from a given list of micro-ops.</p>

<a id="chapter-4-caveats-and-limitations" class="anchor" href="#chapter-4-caveats-and-limitations" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Chapter 4: Caveats and Limitations</h2>

<p>ALICE is a safe, but not a complete tool. That is, the application might
have additional vulnerabilities than those discovered and reported.
ALICE is thus not aligned towards comparing the correctness of different
applications; specifically, any comparisons when not using equivalent
workloads and checkers can easily produce confusing, wrong inferences.
Also, any vulnerability displayed by ALICE might already be known to an
application developer: the application documentation might explicitly
require that the underlying file system not behave in those ways that
will expose the vulnerability, or might simply not provide those
guarantees that are being checked by the checker.</p>

<p>The default file-system model (APM) used by ALICE is designed to also
find vulnerabilities that can get exposed by future file systems; some
crash scenarios that are possible with the default model do not happen
in common current file systems. Also, ALICE’s output (a list of
vulnerabilities) is only designed to show the number of source lines
that require ordering or atomicity. It is thus erraneous to directly
correlate the number of vulnerabilities shown by ALICE with current
real-world impact.</p>

<p>ALICE does not currently attempt to deal with any file attributes
(including modification time) other than the file size, or with the
FD_CLOEXEC and O_CLOEXEC facilities. If the application’s logic (that
is invoked in the workload and the checker) depends on these, ALICE’s
output is probably wrong. Support for a few rarely-used system calls is
also lacking; warning or error messages are displayed by ALICE if the
application workload had invoked such calls. The situation for symlinks
is similar; while the current version of ALICE attempts to support them
slightly, if the application logic depends on symlinks, ALICE’s output
might be wrong.</p>

<p>The current version of ALICE also does not support tracing memory-mapped
writes; applications that use such writes as a part of their (relevant)
update protocol cannot use ALICE. Note that a version of ALICE used in
our published research paper
(<a href="http://research.cs.wisc.edu/adsl/Publications/alice-osdi14.html">http://research.cs.wisc.edu/adsl/Publications/alice-osdi14.html</a>)
traced memory-mapped writes, but support was removed in the interest of
distributability.</p>

<p>Adding support for file attributes, CLOEXEC, symlinks, and mmap() writes
does not require any changes to the design of ALICE, and might be done
in future versions if users deem them helpful.</p>
